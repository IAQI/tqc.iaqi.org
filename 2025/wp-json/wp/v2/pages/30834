The scientific objective of TQC is to bring together the theoretical quantum information science community to present and discuss the latest advances in the field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Areas of interest for TQC include, but are not restricted to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>quantum algorithms<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>models of quantum computation<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>quantum complexity theory<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>simulation of quantum systems<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>quantum cryptography<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>quantum communication<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>quantum information theory<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>quantum estimation and measurement<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>intersection of quantum information and condensed-matter theory<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>intersection of quantum information and machine learning<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Submission Guidelines<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Submission Guidelines<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the goal of TQC is to bring together researchers on all aspects of quantum information, submissions are solicited for two tracks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is the <strong>With<\/strong> <strong>Proceedings track<\/strong>.&nbsp; Submissions to this track must be original manuscripts that <strong>have not previously appeared in published form and are not simultaneously submitted to another publishing venue<\/strong>. Accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference and will be published in the conference proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second track is <strong>Without Proceedings <\/strong>(talk only).&nbsp; Accepted submissions will be presented orally at the conference but will not appear in the proceedings. This track allows authors to publish their work elsewhere and accepts already published material. Previously published submissions must still be current to be competitive for acceptance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;It is possible to present a poster if a submission is not accepted for a talk, in either track, and poster-only submissions are also possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years the overall <strong>acceptance rate<\/strong> for all papers submitted to TQC has been approximately 25%. The PC will target a minimum of 10 articles to be published in the proceedings and therefore the acceptance rates could differ between the two tracks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Paper Prize<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Best Paper prize will be given to the best paper accepted to the conference (both tracks combined). The program committee may decide to split the prize between multiple papers, or to decline to make an award.<br><strong><br>Best Student Paper Prize<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Best Student Paper prize will be given to the best student paper accepted at the conference (both tracks combined). The program committee may decide to split the prize between multiple papers, or to decline to make an award. A submission is eligible for the Best Student Paper prize if and only if the main author(s) is\/are a student(s) at the time of the submission and will present the work at TQC, and further a significant portion of the work (at least 60%) has been done by said student(s), including contributing the majority of the key ideas. Eligibility can only be indicated at the time of submission. The PC chair is free to ask for any clarifications regarding the students&#8217; contributions at any time. If a paper qualifies for the Best Student Paper prize, it should not be disqualified from being considered for the Best Paper Prize, and vice versa; a paper meriting both prizes should be given both prizes.<strong>Submission format (applies to both With and Without Proceedings tracks): &nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All submissions should include <em>both<\/em> an extended abstract and a technical version and should be submitted as two separate files in PDF format.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>extended abstract<\/strong> (at most <strong>3 pages<\/strong>, not including references) should contain a non-technical, clear and insightful description of the main ideas, results, their impact,&nbsp;and relationship with concurrent and prior work.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>This extended abstract will be used to evaluate the results&#8217; originality and importance.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The submission should begin with a title and a list of authors.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The text must be in a single column format, use at least 11-point fonts, and have reasonable margins.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the work is currently under submission to, has been accepted at, or has been presented at any other conference(s) or workshop (without proceedings), this should be indicated on the first page of the submission.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>technical manuscript<\/strong> (no page limit).&nbsp; Authors are encouraged to use the &#8220;full version&#8221; of their paper.&nbsp; The submission should have the following format:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The submission should begin with a title, a list of authors, and a short abstract.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This manuscript will be used to verify the correctness of the submission if necessary.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Even if the manuscript comes from an on-line repository, a PDF copy must be uploaded.

In addition, you can submit your work for a poster-only presentation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poster-only submissions must either consist of a short summary <strong>(2 pages)<\/strong> of the work, or follow the guidelines from either of the tracks above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Important note: talk submission to multiple conferences<\/strong> :<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a research community, our goal is that contributed talks at quantum information conferences reflect the breadth of our field. We therefore discourage the parallel submission of works that were previously accepted or presented as talks at a conference with a similar scope, such as QIP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the first page of your submission, indicate if your work is currently under submission to, has been accepted at, or has been presented at any other conference or workshop, as a talk.
