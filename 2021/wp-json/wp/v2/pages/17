Information-theoretically, it is well-known that tomography requires exponential in n &nbsp;many copies of an unknown state &nbsp;in order to estimate it upto small trace distance.&nbsp; But a natural question is, are there models of learning where fewer copies suffice and are there interesting classes of states that can be learned with fewer copies? In this talk I will discuss the following results: (1) learning local Hamiltonians on n qubits&nbsp;using poly(n) many samples&nbsp;of the quantum Gibbs state,&nbsp;(2) In the past few years, there have been various learning models introduced to capture the learnability of quantum states; here I will overview many recent results and discuss various equivalences between these learning models. Both these works pave the way towards a more rigorous application of using machine learning techniques to &nbsp;learning quantum states.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">C\u00e9cilia Lancien<br><strong>Institut de Math\u00e9matiques de Toulouse and CNRS<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>C\u00e9cilia Lancien completed a joint PhD between the Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1<br>(France) and the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (Spain) in June 2016.<br>She then spent two years as a post-doc at the Universidad Complutense de<br>Madrid (Spain).

Those built on regular lattices, i.e. matrix product<br>states (MPS) in dimension 1 and projected entangled pair states (PEPS)<br>in dimension 2 or higher, are of particular interest in condensed matter<br>physics. In this talk, I will try to answer the following general<br>question: which features of MPS and PEPS are generic and which are, on<br>the contrary, exceptional? Or to rephrase it: given an MPS or PEPS<br>sampled at random, what are the features that it displays with either<br>high or low probability? One property which we will focus on is that of<br>having either rapidly decaying or long-range correlations. In a<br>nutshell, the main result I will state is that translation-invariant MPS<br>and PEPS typically exhibit exponential decay of correlations at a high<br>rate. I will show two distinct ways of getting to this conclusion,<br>depending on the dimensional regime under consideration. Both yield<br>intermediate results which are of independent interest, namely: the<br>parent Hamiltonian and the transfer operator of such MPS and PEPS<br>typically have a large spectral gap. If time allows, I will also present<br>on-going attempts at quantifying the amount of genuinely multipartite<br>entanglement in such random MPS and PEPS.<br>The talk will be based mainly on a joint work with David Perez-Garcia,<br>available at arXiv:1906.11682, and on some work in progress with Ion<br>Nechita.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kai-Min Chung<br><strong>Academia Sinica<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kai-Min Chung is a Research Fellow at the Institute of Information Science (IIS), Academia Sinica, Taiwan.

This is a fundamental problem with profound connections to cryptography, data structures, communication complexity, and circuit lower bounds. Investigation of this problem in the quantum setting was initiated by Nayebi, Aaronson, Belovs, and Trevisan (2015), who proved a lower bound of ST^2 = \\Omega(N) for random permutations against classical advice, leaving open an intriguing possibility that Grover\u2019s search can be sped up to time O(\\sqrt{N\/S}). Recent works by Hhan, Xagawa, and Yamakawa (2019), and Chung, Liao, and Qian (2019) extended the argument for random functions and quantum advice, but the lower bound remains ST^2 = \\Omega(N).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this talk, I\u2019ll present a general framework to answer the question negatively. Specifically, our framework shows that even with quantum advice, ST + T^2 = \\Omega(N) is required for an algorithm to invert random functions. It means that for S = O(\\sqrt{N}), even S qubits of quantum advice cannot help to speed up Grover\u2019s search, which remains optimal. Furthermore, for S = \\Omega(\\sqrt{N}), further improvements to our bounds would imply new classical circuit lower bounds, as shown by Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (2019). Our framework can also be used to prove (nearly) tight quantum time-space tradeoffs for several fundamental problems in cryptography, such as Yao\u2019s box problem, distinguishing pseudorandom generators, and salted collision-finding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will also discuss other types of quantum time-space tradeoffs problems motivated by quantum cryptography and highlight some challenging open questions such as quantum time-memory tradeoffs for collision-finding and post-quantum memory-hard functions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Keynotes Scott AaronsonUniversity of Texas at Austin BQP After 28 Years I\u2019ll discuss the now-ancient question of where BQP fits amongclassical complexity classes.&nbsp; After reviewing some basics (not all ofthem universally known) from the 1990s, I\u2019ll discuss the Forrelationproblem that I introduced in 2009 to yield an oracle separationbetween BQP and PH, and the dramatic &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/keynotes\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> &#8220;Keynotes&#8221;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-17","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/17","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=17"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/17\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":64,"href":"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/17\/revisions\/64"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=17"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
