<h2>Instructions for authors:</h2>
<p> Please also have a look at the <a href="cfp.html"> Call for Papers</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Conference (Talk + proceedings) Track: </b> <br>
Submissions must not substantially duplicate work published elsewhere
or submitted in parallel to a journal or any other conference/workshop
that has proceedings. The length of the submission must be at most 15
pages excluding bibliography and appendices. The text must be in a
single column format, use at least 11-point fonts, and have reasonable
margins. The submission should begin with a title, a list of authors,
and a short abstract. The introduction should summarize the
contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist
reader. Committee members are not required to read appendices; the
paper should be intelligible without them. Submissions should
preferably be in PDF format. </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Workshop (Talk only) Track: </b> <br>
Authors may submit a paper published elsewhere or an original
manuscript. A Workshop track submission must either follow the format
guidelines for Conference track submissions, or if the submission has
been accepted for publication elsewhere, the submission may consist in
the manuscript in its accepted or published form. In all cases,
information about previous publication or concurrent submission, if
any, should be indicated on the first page of the submission.<br>
We note that the same standards of quality will apply to Conference and
Workshop papers. In particular, Workshop track submission are expected
to follow the standards of papers submitted for publication in the
Conference track (and should consist of more than a 3-page summary).</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Poster Track:</b> <br>
Poster submissions must either consist in a short summary (2-3 pages)
of the work, or follow the guidelines from either of the tracks
above.&nbsp; Talk submissions that are not retained will automatically
be considered for the poster session. Authors of poster submissions
made before the Early-Poster submission deadline will be notified by
the Decision notification date. A Late-Poster round allows for much
later submissions (and notification) for posters only.<br>
The size of the poster panel is 1185 mm x 1460 mm. We recommend to use <span style="font-weight: bold;">A0 format</span>&nbsp;(841 x 1189 mm | 33.1
x 46.8 inches).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that authors of accepted papers in the Conference track
will be required to submit their final camera-ready version using the
2016 LIPIcs class file, by the "final manuscript deadline". Final
versions should be 12-15 pages in length, excluding bibliography and
appendices. When appendices are present, they should not be overly
long. The 2016 LIPIcs class file is available here:</p>
