As the goal of TQC is to bring together researchers on all aspects of quantum information, submissions are solicited for two tracks:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CONFERENCE TRACK<\/strong>&nbsp;(talk + proceedings): Submissions to this track must be original papers that have not previously appeared in published form. Accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference and will appear in the conference proceedings (published in the well known open-access LIPIcs\u2013Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics series). The PC will target a minimum of 10 articles to be published in the proceedings and therefore the acceptance rates could differ between the two tracks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Submission format: The length of the main text must be at most 10 pages excluding bibliography and appendices. The text must be in a single column format, use at least 11-point fonts, and have reasonable margins. The submission should begin with a title, a list of authors, and a short abstract. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Submissions should be in PDF format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WORKSHOP TRACK&nbsp;<\/strong>(talk only): We solicit submissions for talk-only papers; accepted submissions will be presented orally at the conference but will not appear in the proceedings. This track allows authors to publish their work elsewhere and accepts previously published material. Previously published submissions must still be current to be competitive for acceptance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Submission format: Submission should consist of a 3 page extended abstract (excluding references) and a technical version, both with at least 11-point fonts and reasonable margins. The extended abstract should contain a non-technical, clear and insightful description of the main ideas, results, and their impact. The technical version will be considered only at the discretion of the program committee. Both the abstract and the technical version should be uploaded as a single PDF file. If the work corresponding to the submission is published, has been submitted elsewhere, or appears on arXiv, then it should be indicated on the first page of the submission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on submissions received, preference may be given to submissions to the Conference Track. In recent years the overall acceptance rate for all papers submitted to TQC has been approximately 25%. One of the Conference Track submissions will be selected for an OUTSTANDING PAPER PRIZE.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also solicit poster-only submissions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>POSTER<\/strong>: Submissions must either consist of a short summary (2 pages) of the work, or follow the guidelines from either of the tracks above. If the work corresponding to the submission is published, has been submitted elsewhere, or appears on arXiv, then it should be indicated on the first page of the submission. Talk submissions that are not retained will automatically be considered for the poster session. Authors of poster submissions made before the Early-Poster submission deadline will be notified by the Decision notification date. A Late-Poster round allows for much later submissions (and notification) for posters only.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All submissions for talks or posters must be made electronically through the online submission system <a href=\"https:\/\/easychair.org\/conferences\/?conf=tqc2021\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/easychair.org\/conferences\/?conf=tqc2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EasyChair<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please direct any questions or comments to the PC chair at tqc2021@easychair.org<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Program committee:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Barbara Amaral (Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Anurag Anshu (University of California, Berkeley)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Srinivasan Arunachalam (IBM T.
