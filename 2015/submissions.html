<h2 id="toc_1">Submissions</h2>

<p>The aim of TQC is to bring together researchers to present and discuss their most recent discoveries in an exciting atmosphere.
With this objective in mind, <strong>abstract material which has been previously published in other conference proceedings or journals or which is scheduled for publication prior to TQC will not be considered for acceptance at TQC</strong>.
However, authors can submit work that has been presented orally or by poster at other conferences, that has been submitted to (but not yet accepted in) a journal, or which has been posted on open access electronic repositories (e.g. arXiv).
We actually encourage submissions to such open access electronic repositories.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Online Submissions</h2>

<p><strong>As of February 6, 2015, submissions are closed.</strong></p>

<p>All submissions must be made electronically through the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tqc2015">online submission system</a> (EasyChair) at the TQC 2015 EasyChair page.
Please select (exactly) one of the following three categories which your submission most likely fits for choosing the topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Information Theory</li>
<li>Physics</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tqc2015">Click here to log in and submit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Notes on the use of EasyChair</h3>

<p>You must have an EasyChair account to submit a paper.
To create an account, please go to the <a href="https://www.easychair.org/account/signup.cgi">EasyChair signup page</a>.
Once you register with EasyChair, a confirmation email and a link to create your account will be sent to you.
You must finish creating an account within 5 days after your request.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Other Information</h2>

<h3 id="toc_5">Instructions for speakers and posters</h3>

<p>The workshop will consist of invited talks, contributed talks, and a poster session.
Contributors can choose a preferred presentation type from Talk only, Poster only, or Talk or Poster.
A submission of the Talk or Poster type will be reviewed as an oral presentation and if it is not accepted as an oral presentation, it will then be reviewed as a poster.</p>

<p>The submission deadline is February 6 2015.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Submission for a Contributed Talk (Talk only, Talk or Poster)</h3>

<p>Contributors are invited to submit a paper (at most 15 pages) presenting original, unpublished research results.</p>

<p>Please use the template file and the LIPIcs class file: <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/styles/lipics/lipics-authors.tgz">LaTeX Template files</a>.
(If you have trouble using these files, please see the <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/styles/lipics/lipics-authors/lipics-manual.pdf">LIPIcs Manual</a>.)</p>

<p>If the authors believe that more details are essential to substantiate the main claims, they may include a clearly marked appendix (or a reference to a version on arxiv.org) that will be read at the discretion of the program committee.</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">Submission for a Poster (Poster only)</h3>

<p>Contributors are invited to submit an extended abstract (at most 2 pages on A4- or Letter-size paper using at least 11-point fonts, in PDF format and must include the title of the paper, author&#39;s names, affiliations, a short abstract summarizing the results).
If more details are necessary, the authors can include an appendix or link to arxiv.org version, which will be read at the discretion of the program committee.</p>

<p>Please use the template file and the LNCS class file:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="files/template.tex">LaTeX Template file</a></li>
<li><a href="files/llncs.cls">LNCS class file</a></li>
<li><a href="files/template.pdf">Sample paper in PDF</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_8">Proceedings</h3>

<p>Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the conference, which are published in the <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/">Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics</a> (LIPIcs) series.
A selection of posters will also be invited to submit optionally a paper for the proceedings.</p>

<p>The LIPIcs series guarantees perennial, free and easy electronic access, while the authors retain the rights over their work (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported">CC-BY 3.0</a>).
In other words, <strong>publishing a paper in the TQC proceedings is equivalent to posting it on the arXiv</strong>.
In particular, <strong>abstract material can be published elsewhere after TQC</strong>.
Note though that, contrarily to the arXiv and similarly to a journal, TQC submissions are peer-reviewed.</p>

<p>Publication of accepted abstracts in the proceedings is not an obligation, but is strongly encouraged.
Remember that this is not different than submitting to the arXiv.</p>

<p>The proceedings will be published after TQC.
The final versions of the accepted papers are due five months after the submission deadline and about one month after the conference. </p>

<h3 id="toc_9">Notification and submission of extended abstract</h3>

<p>All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee, and notification of acceptance or rejection will be made on March 16, 2015.
Authors of accepted papers for oral presentations or a poster session should prepare a short abstract (at most two pages on A4- or Letter-size paper using at least 11-point fonts) to be included in a booklet which will be distributed to participants during the conference.</p>

<ul>
<li>The short abstract format is the same as the LNCS format for poster submission, so please use the same style files.</li>
<li>Abstracts should be sent by May 1 2015 in PDF format to tqc2015 AT ulb.ac.be.</li>
<li>The PDF file should be named &quot;TQC2015abstract_talk_(presentation number).pdf&quot; for a talk or &quot;TQC2015abstract_poster_(presentation number).pdf&quot; for a poster, and the subject of the email should be the same as the file name.</li>
</ul>
