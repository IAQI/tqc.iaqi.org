Usually this will be the name you are most comfortable with in a professional context, for example the author name you use in publications, a shortening of your name that is widely known for in the community, or your new name which may not yet be known to all your colleagues. It is entirely your choice. You may share your pronouns with the organizers and decide whether you want them displayed on your conference badge. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TQC 2024 participants should carry and display their conference badges for the duration of the event, barring safety concerns, which should be communicated to the onsite organizers, preferably in advance. Badges display the participant&#8217;s name as registered for TQC 2024, their main affiliation, and, optionally their pronouns, if the participant consented to sharing them upon registration. At the event, participants may additionally add stickers to their own badge to indicate aspects such as dietary restrictions, willingness to appear in conference photos and whether they are actively looking for work opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At registration and whenever you are not visibly displaying a conference badge at a participants-only session of the event, TQC 2024 organizers and volunteers may ask you for your name as registered, to show them the registration confirmation email, or to confirm your identity in a way of your choosing, in order to cross-check with the participants registry. You may choose not to abide, in which case you may be asked to leave the event premises.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vendors, organizers and volunteers may ask you if you have dietary restrictions at sessions involving food. Answering is optional. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the event, participants, sponsors, exhibitors or vendors may ask you for your personal information. However, repeatedly asking a participant for personal information is not in good form. Providing your personal information to sponsors or other participants is optional, and you should review their privacy policies to address your particular needs and concerns about how they will treat your personal information.&nbsp;If someone makes you feel uncomfortable by repeatedly asking for your personal information, or in any other way, please contact an onsite organizer or volunteer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"notes\">General notes<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The TQC 2024 organizing committee reserves the right to change, amend, add or remove any of the above Terms &amp; Conditions in its sole discretion and without prior notice.
