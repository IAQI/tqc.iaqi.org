Each poster will be assigned a \u201ctable\u201d (i.e., a group video chat room with a virtual whiteboard) where presenters will upload their poster in the PDF format. The participants will be able to interact with poster presenters using text chat, video call or the whiteboard. Participants of the discussion can also share their screen to help the discussion. The distribution of posters across the \u201cbuildings\u201d and \u201cfloors\u201d (<strong>see Poster session schedule\/floors<\/strong>) is available <a href=\"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/program\/poster-session-schedule-floors\/\"><strong>online<\/strong><\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Poster session will be purely browser-based.

In particular, the Poster\u00a0<strong>session cannot be attended using a mobile device<\/strong>\u00a0(the Whiteboard and\/or screen sharing is not supported by Remo on mobile devices). Visit\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/geartest.remo.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/geartest.remo.co<\/a>\u00a0to verify that your system satisfies the requirements (even though Linux is not officially supported by Remo, you may find it possible to use the Remo platform on Linux systems anyway). To use the video-chat feature, you must grant your browser access to your microphone and camera.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are detailed instructions on how to access and use the TQC 2021 Poster session.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>During the Poster session<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Poster session schedule\/floors<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>The event can only be accessed during the scheduled sessions (on Tuesday, July 6th, and on Wednesday, July 7th). To access the event, follow the \u201cLog in\u201d instructions below. During each session the posters will be divided across two different Remo \u201cbuildings\u201d (on Tuesday these buildings will be labelled \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d, on Wednesday \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d. If only a single building is necessary on either day, then only \u201cA\u201d or \u201cC\u201d will be present, respectively). In each building, there are five \u201cfloors\u201d. On the first floor, the Help Desk is located; here you can talk to the organizers and their staff. The remaining \u201ctables\u201d serve as a testing place and the landing area for the users joining the event for the first time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Att_fig1-1200x675-1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-157\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Att_fig1-1200x675-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Att_fig1-1200x675-1-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Att_fig1-1200x675-1-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Att_fig1-1200x675-1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Figure 1: overview of the platform\u00a0<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The remaining floors are designated for poster presentations.

You should see your icon (showing your photo or first initial) displayed at your table, see \u201cThe circle with your icon indicates the table you are at\u201d in Figure 1. To check out the poster, click the \u201cWhiteboard\u201d button in the main toolbar (alternatively, the presenter may decide to present their poster via screen sharing instead of the Whiteboard).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NB!<\/strong>&nbsp;When joining a table, ensure your microphone is muted. Unmute yourself to ask questions, but remember to turn the microphone back off when you are not speaking. We suggest that you leave your camera on when participating the Poster session. Notice that Remo allows guests to annotate and change the contents of the Whiteboard; please use this option only with presenter\u2019s permission. The Poster session will be moderated for disruptive behavior. Please do ask presenter\u2019s permission before downloading, sharing or recording the poster.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you open the Whiteboard, the poster in all likelihood will have extremely low resolution at first. Please allow a few minutes for the PDF to load and be displayed correctly. If the issue persists even after 10 minutes, please contact TQC staff (either at the HelpDesk on the first floor in \u201cA\u201d or \u201cC\u201d buildings or by sending us an email).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interacting with others<\/strong><\/h6>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"932\" height=\"85\" src=\"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Att_fig5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-162\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Att_fig5.png 932w, https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Att_fig5-300x27.png 300w, https:\/\/tqc2021.lu.lv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Att_fig5-768x70.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Figure 5: the main toolbar<\/em>&nbsp;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can turn on your camera and microphone in the main toolbar (Figure 5).
