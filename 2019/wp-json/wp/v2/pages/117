As the goal of TQC is to bring together researchers on all aspects of quantum information, submissions are solicited for two tracks:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><hr \/><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><strong>Conference (talk + proceedings):<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Submissions to this track must be original papers that have not previously appeared in published form. Accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference and will appear in the conference proceedings. The PC will target a minimum of 10 articles to be published in the proceedings and therefore the acceptance rates could differ between the two tracks.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 90px;\"><strong><em>Submission format:<\/em> <\/strong>The length of the submission must be at most 15 pages excluding bibliography and appendices. The text must be in a single column format, use at least 11-point fonts, and have reasonable margins. The submission should begin with a title, a list of authors, and a short abstract. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Submissions should be in PDF format.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><hr \/><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><strong>Workshop (talk only):<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">We solicit submissions for talk-only papers; accepted submissions will be presented orally at the conference but will not appear in the proceedings. This track allows authors to publish their work elsewhere and accepts already published material.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 90px;\"><strong><em>Submission format:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Submission should consist of <em><strong>both<\/strong><\/em> an extended abstract (3-4 pages, not including the references) and a technical version (no page limit), both with at least 11-point fonts and reasonable margins. The extended abstract should contain a non-technical, clear and insightful description of the main ideas, results, and their impact. The technical version will be considered only at the discretion of the program committee. Both the abstract and the technical version should be uploaded as a single PDF file. If the work corresponding to the submission is published, has been submitted elsewhere, or appears on arXiv, then it should be indicated on the first page of the submission.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><hr \/><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Depending on submissions received, preference may be given to submissions to the Conference Track. In recent years the overall acceptance rate for all papers submitted to TQC has been below 25%. One of the Conference Track submissions will be selected for an OUTSTANDING PAPER AWARD.<\/p>\n<p>We also solicit poster-only submissions:<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Poster: <\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Submissions must either consist of a short summary (2-3 pages) of the work, or follow the guidelines from either of the tracks above.

Talk submissions that are not retained will automatically be considered for the poster session. Authors of poster submissions made before the Early-Poster submission deadline will be notified by the Decision notification date.
